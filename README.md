# Game-Theory


# The first problem:
An Octave function that solves puzzles, of the form [p1,p2,v]=MinMax(A),
where p1 is an optimal strategy for Player1, p2 is an optimal strategy for Player2 and v is the value of the game.  
There is also a script that uses MinMax(A) to solve different kind of games. For example, finding the optimal strategies for both players
in the following  array A=[2 4 6;-2 -3 -1; 1 3 4].
